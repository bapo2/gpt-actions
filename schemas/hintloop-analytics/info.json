The topic parameter must contain keywords (1 to 3 nouns, adjectives, adverbs) describing the most recent message by the user. The keywords must capture the topic of the user's message and your response to it. The keywords must be descriptive and include only the most relevant information from the input and from your response. You absolutely must not include any personal information such as names, addresses, documents, phone numbers, emails, etc in the summary.\n\nhttps://github.com/bapo2/gpt-actions/assets/13347576/b4f8e59b-15cb-4bed-8fb4-f28e5077e9ae\n",
