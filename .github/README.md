<p><b>Description:</b><br>

Because [@elmstedt](https://github.com/elmstedt) mentioned on the forums that those looking to create API actions should use [apis.guru](https://apis.guru/) (among other resources) for reference in creating schemas, I've decided to write an action that should make this easier by allowing GPT to look for information from this web service all on its own.

This isn't perfect, as some API specs can be quite long and will thus give the `ResponseTooLargeError`, however I have tried to compensate for this by instructing the model to return a link to the appropriate API docs in the event that it cannot parse the spec directly from the site.</p>

<p><b>Description:</b><br>

This action allows GPT to read entries on DevDocs via `devdocs.io`. Simply provide it with the URL of the entry (e.g. "https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/array/fill") and it will attempt to use a GET request to read the raw HTML of said entry. This is a makeshift implementation because DevDocs provides no official API for reading from its website.

Occasionally, this may return a `ResponseTooLargeError`, which is caused by the response having >100k characters. **This is a limitation of ChatGPT, not of DevDocs, and there's not much I can do about it sadly.**</p>

<p><b>Description:</b><br>

This allows GPT to use the `api.github.com` endpoint to traverse directories in a repository similar to how one would use the `ls` command. It also allows fetching of a given file's `download_url` to pass to the file reader if both actions are present on the same GPT.

Providing an API key is optional when reading from public repos, but is required when reading from private ones. To create one for GPT to use, simply go to [the "developer settings" page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create a PAT with read-access to whatever you want GPT to be able to view.</p>

<p><b>Description:</b><br>

This is a free action that allows the user to track product analytics for their GPTs.
To get started the user needs to create a free account at https://hintloop.com/analytics.

hintloop analytics can track DAU, the number of messages, the number of chats, the rating history, popular conversation topics, and more for free.

Authentication guide: https://hintloop.com/learn/docs/intro

You also need to add this to your system prompt:

> First, you must ALWAYS call send_analytics at the beginning of the conversation with the topic parameter and again before EVERY reply. The topic parameter must contain keywords (1 to 3 nouns, adjectives, adverbs) describing the most recent message by the user. The keywords must capture the topic of the user's message and your response to it. The keywords must be descriptive and include only the most relevant information from the input and from your response. You absolutely must not include any personal information such as names, addresses, documents, phone numbers, emails, etc in the summary.

This allows GPT to make several types of queries to any of several StackExchange boards. The documentation for StackExchange's API can be found [here.](https://api.stackexchange.com/) This is useful if GPT happens to run into a development problem that it has difficulty solving, and is a good source of some information in general.</p>

<!-- Description -->
## ü§î What is This?

This repository is meant as a compendium of action-schemas for [ChatGPT's](https://chat.openai.com/) "custom GPT" feature, which allows users to implement highly customizable API function-calls into their prompt-tuned instances of GPT, letting it perform a wide variety of tasks using request to said APIs. This is accomplished by providing the model with an OpenAPI-spec compliant schema (in either JSON or YAML format) that describes the API call(s) to be made in detail, including the request body, headers, and query parameters, as well as the expected response body and status code (if need be). The model then uses this schema to generate a request to the API, and returns the response body as its output, which it can then use in completions as context for the task being performed.

This feature is extremely powerful, and can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks, from simple things like getting the weather or searching for a video on YouTube, to more complex tasks like creating and managing a GitHub repository programmatically. See the [official ChatGPT docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions) for more information on how this feature works. **In essence, anything accessible via an API can be interacted with by the model using this feature, with virtually no limitations on what can be done.**

In the interest of building a community around this incredibly versatile feature, and to allow for the development of more capable and powerful actions to equip GPT with, I created this repository as a place for users to share their action-schemas publicly, so that others can use them in their own "custom GPTs", and so that they can be improved upon iteratively by the community as a whole. **If you have an action-schema you'd like to share, please consider contributing it to this repository!** See the [contributing](#-contributing) section for more information on how to do so.

<!-- How to Use -->
## üìñ How to Use

<h4 align="center">
    <img alt="How to import actions" width="100%" src="./importing-actions.gif">
</h4>

To use an action from this repository, simply copy the import URL of the action you'd like to use, and **paste it into the "Import from URL" field** in the "Add actions" section of the ChatGPT webapp's "Create a GPT" panel. After this, you can test the action by either prompting the model to use it or by clicking "Test" next to the `path` you wish to test. If the action is working properly, you should see a status indicator that the model is querying the appropriate endpoint, after which it will show if the action was successful or not.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using an action that requires authentication, you will need to provide the appropriate credentials in the "Authentication" section of the "Add actions" panel. If applicable, the instructions for this will be included in the action's description (if not, please open an issue on this repository requesting that the author add them).

## ü§ù Contributing

*If you'd like to contribute an action-schema to this repository, please follow the steps below:*

1. **[Submit a new schema for approval](https://github.com/bapo2/gpt-actions/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new-schema&projects=&template=new_action_template.yml&title=%5BNew+GPT+Action%5D%3A+) by filling out the template provided.** This will aid you in creating a new issue for the schema you wish to contribute, and will ensure that all the necessary information is provided for the schema to be approved and added to the repository.
2. **The schema will be automatically validated by a GitHub workflow,** ensuring that all required information is provided and that the schema is syntactically valid according to what is required by the respective format accepted by the ChatGPT webapp.
3. **If the schema is valid and all required information is provided, it will be marked for manual review.** This is to ensure that the schema is not malicious, otherwise harmful, or breaks any of the rules outlined in the repo's [code of conduct.](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
4. **Once the schema has manually been reviewed and approved by a repository maintainer, it will be marked for inclusion.** This means that, at the next PR triggered by workflow dispatch, the schema will be added to the repository among the other existing entries. PRs for this repository are structured as batches of all schemas that have been marked for inclusion since the last PR. This is so that the repository is updated in bulk rather than one schema at a time and so that we can keep track of the number of schemas that have been contributed to the repository. **This is done fairly often, so you shouldn't have to wait long for your schema to be added to the repository.**

> [!TIP]
> If the schema is not valid, the workflow will attempt to provide a sufficiently descriptive error message to help you fix the issue, at which point you can simply edit the issue to fix the problem and the workflow will re-run automatically.

*If you'd like to [contribute to the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) in other ways, such as by improving the documentation, adding new features, or fixing bugs in the workflows, please feel free to submit a PR:*

1. **[Fork the repository.](https://github.com/bapo2/gpt-actions/fork)** This will create a copy of the repository under your own account, which you can then make changes to. You only need to copy the default branch, `main`.
2. **Make the changes you'd like to contribute.** This can be done either directly on GitHub or by cloning the repository to your local machine and making the changes there.
3. **[Submit a pull request.](https://github.com/bapo2/gpt-actions/compare)** This will open a new PR, which will be reviewed by a repository maintainer. If the changes are approved, they will be merged into the repository at an appropriate time as not to conflict with automated workflows.
